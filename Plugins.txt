 As of ApexDC version 1.5.5 plugins are now officially part of DC++. This implies the following changes:

  1. Most up to date versions of most plugins should be found in following locations:
	<https://launchpad.net/dcpp-plugin-sdk-cpp> (C++ SDK project)
	<https://launchpad.net/dcpp-plugin-sdk-c> (C SDK project)
     This applies to ScriptPlugin (formerly LuaPlugin) and ExamplePlugin (formerly SamplePlugin) respectively.

  2. The development of the core Plugin API has moved to DC++ project at <https://launchpad.net/dcplusplus>.

  3. The plugin API shipped with ApexDC will thus remain identical, or least compatible, to that of DC++ and any
     future updates to the API will be shipped as needed in maintenance releases to the most recent major version
     of ApexDC.

   4. Currently available mature plugin projects can be found over at <http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/plugins.html>
